# Reflection on my Intended Design

I have some classes missing in my diagram, 4 of the classes missing in my diagram are the Tiles with the 3 subtitles ( startTile, freeTile, propertyTile ). I did put all the tiles in the board class as functions but after I had done task 1 in this assignment I can agree that they should have been classes instead of functions in the board class. I still do think it would be possible to have all of the Tiles as functions in the board class, but that could lead to that it would be alot of functions in the board class so the better way of doing this is by making different classes for all the tiles that are connected to the board class like shown in the diagram. I don't have any humanPlayer class either, i was thinking that humanPlayer and Player were combined into one but it makes more sense to separate them into two classes. When combining them into one class it makes it pretty difficult to see what is happening and that the class is getting too many functions inside of it. I also had an <User> Interface that I was thinking should be like the ConsoleUI. The reason why I left my <User> Interface empty is because I was not sure how I would represent a function that only prints stuff. I also had one extra class that was named computerPlayer that we were told in the description of the previous assignment to add. Apart from all that, the classes in the class diagram are pretty much the same.

There are not some bigger differences between the naming in the classes. The only difference I can notice is the naming in the ConsoleUI where it has a name inside of itself. A class name should always start with a capital letter and there should be no spaces in the names. Where you normally use spaces you just make the next words first letter to a capital letter and not use the space so that it’s still possible to see where the words are separated from each other. Another important thing when setting a class name is that it should be easy to understand what’s inside the class without having to go into the class and look at the body of the class.

When it comes to the relation between the classes there are alot of differences. I was using a filled line instead of an Association relationship line, but now after some serious thoughts I realized that the filled line should have been an association relationship. And since I did not have the Tiles as separate classes I did not use the association relationship that just points back to itself for ‘next’ and ‘prev’. And since we are talking about the text that sits on the lines I also missed to set the text on the relationships between the classes. I did not use the inherited arrows from the subclasses for the tile since I did not have any tile classes as previously mentioned. I did not use enough Dependency arrows between the relationships that were dependent on another class, so that i could have done better.

I did use dependency/association relationships to connect my objects. I think it would have been a good idea to use the id-connections though since it would have been easier to follow in what order everything would have happened in but since i did know more about dependency/association relationships i did use that for this diagram.

I have most of the code in two of my classes and two of my classes are empty. If i would have made this type of diagram again i would have tried to make more classes so that i could be able split up the code between the classes so that one/two classes are not having most of the codes inside of them. An easy fix that I did realize when looking at the ‘correct’ diagram is that my tiles should have been 4 different classes and that my player should have been 2 different classes, one for the humanPlayer and one for Player indeed of 1 for both of them.
The difference between the object diagrams is that I am using dependency arrows in my object diagram and that I am having too many objects for the current senarium. One of the biggest differences between the diagrams is that  my diagram does not show how the tiles are working with the circular doubly linked list and how the different tiles are connected to each other. The last small difference between the object diagrams is some of the variables in the objects and the object names, the object names should have the object name followed by classname. I only write the classname.

The first difference i noticed about the two sequences diagrams is that my sequence diagram is not that detailed compared to the other sequence diagram,
The next thing I noticed is that I only use one type of arrow for everything and the other sequence diagrams are using two different types of arrows, a synchronous message arrow and a reply/return message arrow. Another thing I did find as a difference between the diagrams is that my Names for the objects are incorrect here as well, i only have the name for the object and not the object name followed by the class name. Last thing i did notice is that i don't use any arrows that are pointing from an object and directly back to that same object anywhere to show any functions that are used only in that particular object.

I think overall I did a pretty good job with the initial design since I have never made this kind of diagram before and I think it did look at least pretty close to the diagrams we were shown. The biggest flaw I could find in my diagrams compared to the diagrams we were given was all the different arrows. If I would have learned more about the different types of arrows I think I would have gotten pretty close to the diagrams we were given.

The most important thing I have learned by designing my first diagram is all the different types of relationship arrows and in what diagrams to use in the different types of arrows.
