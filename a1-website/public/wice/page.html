                    Seven years ago, i started to play a game called world of warcraft on a private server that was
                    called
                    Warmane. On this private server, i always wanted to kill the last boss in the game called The Lich
                    King.
                    So I did start by level my character from level 0 to level 80. Then when i was level 80 i started
                    to find a group of people that wanted to kill the hardest boss together with me. For this to work,
                    we
                    needed 25 players. So it took some time to gather all those players, but once we had all those
                    players,
                    we started to get better gear for our characters to be able to kill all the bosses leading up to the
                    most difficult boss in the game. To kill all the bosses leading up to the most difficult boss in the
                    game took us around 6 months, but then finally after all that time we did reach the last boss and
                    were
                    able to kill him in just a few weeks.

                <p>
                    The image I have in this text shows that The Lich King (The final
                    boss of the game) is defeated and it also shows most of the players that were there to help me with
                    this
                    goal. Some of these players still play on that server to this day, and others moved on to later
                    version of the game to fight even more difficult challanges that the world of warcraft has to offer.
