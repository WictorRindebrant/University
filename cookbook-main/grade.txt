Had a bit of a unique style, some stuff was more thought out than others. Layout was 
restricted by their "book" design that they stuck with for the rest of the project.

A bit rough, but it does work fairly well. Help page was a little wonky but functional.
Codebase is looking fairly decent, gitlab management is acceptable. Merging was apperently 
a mess since people went off on their own and worked a little too much without consulting 
other members.

Group dynamics appear to be pretty bad among some of them. Group was generally self-running 
though, even with the internal struggles it appears everyone participated in a farily decent 
fashion. 

Overall: D
